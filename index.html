   <h2>Week 3, 09/02/2022</h2>
   <p>This week, we started working now that we're more settled in. <br>
   We got started on TinkerCad and got to mess around a little. The first thing I designed was cheese and then I designed a sink.  </p>

   <h2>Week 5, 09/16/2022</h2>
   <p>This week, we spent a lot of time actually getting to build our Rube Goldburg projects after CAD-ing it last week. On Friday, the challenge was to build a paper boat that could hold weight while in the water. Our boat didn't last very long but it was ok, it was a cool boat(that I also don't have a picture of).</p>
