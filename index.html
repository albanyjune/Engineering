   <h2>Week 3, 09/02/2022</h2>
   <p>This week, we started working now that we're more settled in. <br>
   We got started on TinkerCad and got to mess around a little. The first thing I designed was cheese and then I designed a sink.  </p>

   <h2>Week 5, 09/16/2022</h2>
   <p>This week, we spent a lot of time actually getting to build our Rube Goldburg projects after CAD-ing it last week. On Friday, the challenge was to build a paper boat that could hold weight while in the water. Our boat didn't last very long but it was ok, it was a cool boat(that I also don't have a picture of).</p>

    <h2>Week 6, 09/23/2022</h2>
    <p>We spent most of the week finishing up our Rube Goldburg projects. On the last day of the week, we got to test if they worked and if we needed to adjust anything. We also spent time adjusting the CAD because of a few modifications. Thankfully, for our group project, it worked after a couple tries. With a pully system and some marbles, we were able to pop the ballon after a series of obstacles </p>

     <h2>Week 7, 09/30/2022</h2>
     <p>Starting the new unit that goes into Hardware engineering, we were visited by a Guest speaker on Wedensday. After we listened to the speaker, we had had to "dissect" an old laptop and navigate all the parts. Mr.Kim had us name all the parts on a worksheet and then put the laptop back together when we were done.</p>
